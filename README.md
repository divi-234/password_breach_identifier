I have created a password and email breach detector.
It works in a way in which when we enter our email-id it checks whether the email-id has any breaches or it is leaked anywhere and it also shows in how many breaches has happened.
It also has a password strength checker which checks whether your password is storng or weak and suggest some changes to make the password strong.
It also shows is our password has been leaked in any places. If there is any breaches or leaks it shows the exact number of breaches and also suggest us to change the password.


Detailed Description:
Password Strength Checker:
The project will prompt the user to enter a password and evaluate its strength based on the following factors:

Password length (minimum of 8 characters recommended).
Combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.
Use of digits and special characters.
Absence of common patterns or dictionary words.
Breach Detection:
To detect whether a password has been exposed in previous data breaches, we'll use the "Have I Been Pwned?" (HIBP) API. The HIBP API provides a secure method of checking whether the password has appeared in any data breaches without sending the actual password over the network (it uses a technique called "k-anonymity").

Password Suggestions:
The tool will provide recommendations if the password is weak or if it's found in a breach. It can also suggest a randomly generated secure password if the user wants.

LIBRARIES USED:
requests: To interact with the HIBP API.
re: For regular expressions (for analyzing password complexity).
